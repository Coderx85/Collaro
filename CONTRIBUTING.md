# Contributing to Collaro

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Collaro! It's people like you that make Collaro such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover all of a contributor's interactions with the project include:

- Be respectful of others.
- Keep criticism constructive.
- Before opening a new issue or pull request, please search for existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded into the issue description. Please try to fill out as much of the template as possible.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone the project** to your own machine.
3.  **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature` or `fix/a-bug-fix`.
4.  **Make your changes**.
5.  **Commit your changes** using a descriptive commit message that follows the [Conventional Commits](https.www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
6.  **Push your changes** to your fork: `git push origin feat/my-new-feature`.
7.  **Submit a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

## Coding Guidelines
